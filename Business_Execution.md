## Our Value Proposition

CITY WALK is a gamified fitness app that turns daily walking into a fun, rewarding, and socially connected experience. At its core, it transforms each step into a meaningful action, by converting physical activity into a virtual currency that users spend to build and personalise a digital city. This blend of movement and game mechanics helps users stay motivated, accountable, and consistent in their fitness routines. 

Unlike traditional fitness apps that often rely on repetitive goals, generic achievements, or passive tracking, CITY WALK integrates a fun and interactive city-building mechanic that gives users a visually satisfying sense of progress—each building they unlock is a symbol of their physical effort. 

And to deepen motivation and commitment, CITY WALK introduces an optional real-money wagering system, where users can stake small amounts on meeting their daily step goals. If they succeed, they earn premium virtual rewards. This feature is designed to encourage follow-through without pressure—it is completely optional, risk-managed, and reinforces positive behaviour.

### Key Differentiators from Other Fitness Apps

- **Gamified fitness**: Not just about counting steps, walking is in the core gameplay loop.  
- **Personalised rewards**: Users build their own evolving virtual world. 
- **Social features**: Community leaderboards and group challenges make the experience collaborative and competitive. 
- **Motivation through incentives**: Real-money stakes add an extra layer of commitment for those who want it. 
- **Free and accessible**: No upfront payment, NFTs, or paywalls. Just walk, earn, and play. 

## Sustainability and Business Model

CITY WALK is designed for everyday users—from students who struggle to find motivation to walk more, to casual walkers seeking more engagement, and even older adults looking for light physical activity with a purpose. It fits seamlessly into existing routines: users walk as usual, and the app quietly tracks progress and rewards it. Whether it’s a walk to university, a daily dog walk, or a weekend stroll, the app turns mundane activity into a game with real value.

CITY WALK operates on a **freemium model**, offering all core features for free with optional microtransactions. These include:

- Premium virtual buildings  
- Step multipliers  
- Cosmetic upgrades  
- Wager for premium currency  

This model ensures broad accessibility while generating revenue in a user-friendly, ethical way. There are no barriers to entry. Instead, our monetisation grows as users find value and choose to engage more deeply.

The app also has potential for **social impact** by helping users build healthier habits in a non-intimidating and fun way. CITY WALK contributes to both physical and mental wellbeing. It encourages movement, creates positive feedback loops, and builds community—key pillars in addressing sedentary lifestyles.
