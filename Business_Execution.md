## Our Value Proposition

CITY WALK is a gamified fitness app that turns daily walking into a fun, rewarding, and socially connected experience. At its core, it transforms each step into a meaningful action, by converting physical activity into a virtual currency that users spend to build and personalise a digital city. This blend of movement and game mechanics helps users stay motivated, accountable, and consistent in their fitness routines. 

Unlike traditional fitness apps that often rely on repetitive goals, generic achievements, or passive tracking, CITY WALK integrates a fun and interactive city-building mechanic that gives users a visually satisfying sense of progress—each building they unlock is a symbol of their physical effort. 

And to deepen motivation and commitment, CITY WALK introduces an optional real-money wagering system, where users can stake small amounts on meeting their daily step goals. If they succeed, they earn premium virtual rewards. This feature is designed to encourage follow-through without pressure and it is completely optional, risk-managed, and reinforces positive behaviour.

### Key Differentiators from Other Fitness Apps

- **Gamified fitness**: Not just about counting steps, walking is in the core gameplay loop.  
- **Personalised rewards**: Users build their own evolving virtual world. 
- **Social features**: Community leaderboards and group challenges make the experience collaborative and competitive. 
- **Motivation through incentives**: Real-money stakes add an extra layer of commitment for those who want it. 
- **Free and accessible**: No upfront payment, NFTs, or paywalls. Just walk, earn, and play. 

## Sustainability and Business Model

CITY WALK is designed for everyday users, from students who struggle to find motivation to walk more, to casual walkers seeking more engagement, and even older adults looking for light physical activity with a purpose. It fits seamlessly into existing routines: users walk as usual, and the app quietly tracks progress and rewards it. Whether it’s a walk to university, a daily dog walk, or a weekend stroll, the app turns mundane activity into a game with real value.

CITY WALK operates on a **freemium model**, offering all core features for free with optional microtransactions. These include:

- Premium virtual buildings  
- Step multipliers  
- Cosmetic upgrades  
- Wager for premium currency  

This model ensures broad accessibility while generating revenue in a user-friendly, ethical way. There are no barriers to entry. Instead, our monetisation grows as users find value and choose to engage more deeply.

The app also has potential for social impact by helping users build healthier habits in a non-intimidating and fun way. CITY WALK contributes to both physical and mental wellbeing. It encourages movement, creates positive feedback loops, and builds community. These are all the key pillars in addressing sedentary lifestyles.

## How Does CITY WALK Work?

CITY WALK is designed around a simple, motivating core loop that turns physical activity into tangible progress through gamification.

### Core Gameplay

- The app tracks your daily steps. For every **1,000 steps walked**, users earn **“Step Coins”**, the in-app virtual currency.
- This creates a direct feedback loop: **Walk more, Earn more, Build more**.
- Users spend Step Coins to unlock and place **buildings, parks, and landmarks** in their own virtual city, creating a unique and visual representation of their fitness journey.

### Optional Real-Money Wagering for Premium Rewards

For users looking for an extra push, CITY WALK includes an optional, low-stakes wagering feature:

- Users can **wager small amounts of real money** on hitting a **daily step goal**.
- Upon success, they earn **premium currency**, which can be exchanged for **exclusive digital rewards**, such as rare buildings or city expansions.
- If the goal is not met, the wagered amount is forfeited, providing **risk-managed accountability** while still being entirely voluntary.

### Integrated Social & Community Features

CITY WALK turns walking into a shared experience with built-in social mechanics:

- **Leaderboards**: Track and compare progress with friends, local users, or global players.
- **Team-Based Challenges**: Join walking teams and collaborate toward shared goals.
- **Guilds**: Form small communities, unlock group-based milestones, and benefit from mutual encouragement and accountability.

These features are designed to increase motivation through **friendly competition**, **social support**, and **collective achievements**.

### Freemium, Accessible, and Ethical Monetisation

CITY WALK follows a **freemium model** that prioritises inclusivity and fair design:

- **Free users** have full access to:
  - Step tracking
  - City building
  - Social features
  - Base-level progression

No essential features are locked behind paywalls. Monetisation is built to enhance, not restrict, the user experience—ensuring that users can play meaningfully without ever needing to pay.

## Where Does CITY WALK Fit in the Market?

CITY WALK is more than just a step counter. It is a dynamic fusion of gamification, accountability, and community that redefines how users experience fitness. In a crowded landscape of fitness apps, CITY WALK carves out a unique position by offering a layered and inclusive experience that appeals to both casual users and fitness-focused individuals.

### How CITY WALK Sets Itself Apart from Key Competitors

**Meaningful, Personalized Rewards (vs. Sweatcoin):**

Most apps reward movement with discounts or brand vouchers which are perks that often feel impersonal or irrelevant (Hendelmann, n.d.). 
CITY WALK replaces generic incentives with creative ownership: every step earns currency that lets users design and grow a unique virtual city, complete with buildings, parks, and landmarks that reflect their progress. 
This visual, creative feedback loop gives users a stronger sense of accomplishment and a lasting reason to keep moving with progress you can see, not just spend. 

**No Entry Barriers, Full Access (vs. STEPN):**

While Stepn’s crypto-based model introduces financial rewards, it also requires users to purchase NFTs just to get started which limit access and alienating casual users (Cryptopedia, 2025). 
CITY WALK eliminates that hurdle completely. Anyone can download the app and start playing right away, no crypto wallets or upfront payments required. 
This free-to-play model ensures accessibility, while optional in-app purchases provide a sustainable, ethical monetisation path that doesn’t pressure or exploit users. 

**Consistent, Short-Term Motivation (vs. HealthyWage):**

HealthyWage’s long-term bets on weight loss work well for some, but they’re often high-risk and slow to reward, leading to dropout (Lexell, 2019).
CITY WALK introduces daily and weekly wagering options, giving users immediate motivation with much smaller stakes. 
Whether it’s walking 6,000 steps today or hitting 50,000 in a week, users can bet on themselves to succeed, creating ongoing accountability without long-term pressure. 

**Broad, Flexible Appeal (vs. Zombies, Run!):**

Apps like Zombies, Run! offer a great story-based experience, but their narrative-heavy style limits their appeal to a specific audience (Orin, 2014).
CITY WALK’s gamification is universally relatable, everyone understands city-building. It taps into familiar gaming mechanics that appeal to a wider demographic: from students seeking extra motivation to busy professionals and even older adults wanting a creative way to stay active. 
There’s no single way to play, CITY WALK allows users to choose their pace, their wagers, and their city’s look and feel. 

### Our Position in the Market

CITY WALK is the only fitness app that brings together city-building gameplay, flexible wagering, and social interaction in a frictionless, rewarding way. We don’t just track movement—we transform it into a motivating, social, and creative experience, combining the habit-building power of fitness apps with the engagement of casual mobile games. And we do it without alienating anyone through high costs, steep learning curves, or niche themes.
