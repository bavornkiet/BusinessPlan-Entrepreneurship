# CITY WALK Business Plan

## 1: Product Section

### 1.1: Project Overview

CITY WALK is a revolutionary health and step-tracking application that integrates gamified elements to encourage users to engage in regular walking routines. The app provides an innovative service where users can set and track walking schedules with a built-in step counter. CITY WALK offers a wagering system, allowing users to place real money on their commitment to a walking goal. Where their money will be forfeited if the goal is not met.

To further enhance the engagement and entertainment experience, CITY WALK also features a city-building minigame that greatly utilises freemium games elements. The in-game dual currencies can be earned through using the application’s main function, walking, daily streak and completing set schedules. The virtual currencies can then be spent to purchase roads and buildings in the virtual cityscape, further incentivising continued participation.

Additionally, to create social engagement and competitiveness, CITY WALK allows users to join and create guilds and visit their friends’ city. Guild progresses are committed by each guild member which can be compared to a leaderboard both inter-guild and between guilds.

### 1.1.1: Customer’s Pains and Gains

- **Pains:**
  - Lack of motivation to engage in light exercises (Ebben 2008) (Hongu et al. 2018)
  - Too lazy to walk (Hongu et al. 2018)
  - Inconsistency in maintaining exercise routines (Ebben 2008)
  - Walking is boring and lack engagement (Ettema 2015) (Hongu et al. 2018)
  - Lack of clear goal to determine amount of physical activity (Hongu et al. 2018)

- **Value Proposition:**
  - CITY WALK encourages and motivates people in committing to physical activities and light exercises through gamification elements and competition between friends and guilds.
  - CITY WALK provides quick, engaging and non-disruptive experience, suitable for quick interactions throughout the day.
  - CITY WALK provides a reason for people to walk as it earns them the in-game currencies to progress the city building game.
  - Daily streak and wagering system encourage consistent commitment and determination to complete set schedule, by ensuing fear of losing money or rewards because of missing schedule goals or daily commitments.
  - CITY WALK provides social engagement and competition through friends and guilds-based leaderboard. Allowing users to set their own goal based on progresses they see on other users.

### 1.1.2: Core Features

- **Step Counter:**
  - To monitor and track user’s step, and to be converted to game currency.
- **Set Schedule/Task:**
  - To allow users to customise and set a goal, of number of steps being completed within the certain amount of time.
- **Streak:**
  - **Login streak:**
    - Users gets rewards in game when login to the app, reward differs depending on the number of consecutive login days.
  - **Task/schedule completion streak:**
    - Users gets additional rewards in game when completing set schedules and tasks, reward differs depending on the number of consecutive completions.

### 1.1.3: Monetisation Features

- **Dual Currency (Evans, 2016):**  
  The dual currency system consists of standard  and premium currency with the standard currency being earned through walking, completing set tasks and schedules. A high completion streak, can also earn standard currency which can be spent in shop and purchase roads. Premium currency can be purchased with real money through micro-transactions or earned in very small quantities by completing set tasks and consecutive completion and logins. This system provides a sense of exclusiveness. Free-to-play players can experience the game without any in-game purchases with only standard currencies and very limited premium currencies. The premium currencies unlock additional features such as quicker alternative progression, eliminate waiting time and purchase exclusive items greatly enhances the overall experience.
- **Distancing from Spending Money (Nenad, 2019):**  
  By allowing players to exchange real money with virtual currencies, players become less aware that they are spending real money when they purchase items using purchased premium currencies. Because they are using a virtual medium of exchange, they are less likely to hesitate or consciously track their expenses, making them more inclined to make purchases.
- **Long-Term Engagement:**  
  Premium currency can be earned for free, but only in small amounts or at key intervals. This design encourages players to stay engaged, to log in daily and continue playing over a long period. The gradual accumulation of premium currency keeps players invested in the game, as they anticipate future rewards and progress.
- **Wagering System (Investment System):**  
  Inspired by existing anti-procrastination software such as Forest, the application has a wagering system where players wager their money on a target, and the money can be forfeited if they fail to reach the goal. This encourages first-time payments as they can get their money back. By saving players’ payment method after the first-time payment, it increases the convenience of any future payments, which further distancing players from the concept of spending money and making them less hesitant on any potential future transactions (Nenad, 2019).
- **Monetising Patience (Evans, 2016):**  
 A common feature in freemium games, monetising patience gives players the ability to use real money or premium currency to accelerate progression by either eliminating waiting time or providing a shortcut in progression. This model is famously utilised in successful freemium games such as SimCity, The Simpsons: Tapped Out, and Clash of Clans. Players can pay to skip waiting or time-consuming tasks, effectively buying a shortcut to progression (Hamari, 2011). Additionally, real money can be used to bypass repetitive grinding, making the experience more streamlined (Evans, 2016). The desire for competence further drives monetisation as suggested in the self-determination theory according to Ryan et al. (2000). Players are motivated to collect premium items for progression or obtain achievements and badges as soon as possible, increasing their willingness to make purchases.
- **Time-Limited Events and Items (Evans, 2016):**  
  With implementation of time-limited events and items, it creates a sense of urgency and scarcity around the acquisition of the exclusive limited items, encourages micro-transactions to acquire currencies quickly in fear of missing out the item because of short on required number of currencies. This strategy, frequently used in games like The Simpsons: Tapped Out and various gacha games.

**SHOP CONTENT:**  
- Standard buildings – Can be purchased with standard/premium currency, will remain in shop forever.
- Premium buildings – Can be purchased with premium currency, will remain in shop forever.
- Time limited standard buildings – Can be purchased with standard/premium currency, will remain in shop a limited time.
- Time limited premium buildings – Can be purchased with standard/premium currency, will remain in shop a limited time.

**GAMEPLAY LOOP:**  
- Start with one block of owned road.
- Earn currency to buy the next road adjacent to the owned road.
- Keeps earning currencies and buying roads until an empty land is surrounded with purchased roads.
- Purchase buildings from shop to build on surrounded empty land.
- Place and wait for the building to be completed (Can use premium currency to skip the wait).
- Each completed building increase currency earning rate to afford more expensive roads and items in shop.

**GAMEPLAY DESIGN:**  
- Designed for quick, convenient and frequent interaction (Hjorth and Richardson, 2009)
  - Use to occupies “dead times”, to alleviates quick boredoms such as between transports or outside.

### 1.1.4: Engagement Sustain Features

- **Leaderboard:**
  - **Inter-guild leaderboard:**
    - Users can see and compare progresses of members within their guild.
  - **Between guild leaderboard:**
    - Users can see the combined progress of their own guild and other guilds worldwide.
  - **Between Friends leaderboard:**
    - Display registered friends’ city, progress and achievements.
  - Create a sense of competitiveness between players to wishes to better out the other (Hamari et al. 2017)
    - Motivates to compete for a better progress.
    - Opponents acts as a goal for player to reach and beat to create sense of accomplishment, which satisfy competence in self-determination theory (Ryan et al. 2000).

## 1.2: Challenges and Risk Mitigation

### 1.2.1: Monetary Wagering System Risks

The game enables user to wage real money; however, some users might have concerns regarding the destination of their money, the refund process, trust and transparency with the system and associated risk with impulsive spending. To mitigate these risks, Escrow system is used to securely holds the wagered money and automatically refund upon verification of completion of tasks. A clear in-app explanations, progress indicators and notifications provide users with reassurance on the refund process. Furthermore, spending limit and alerts are introduced to help user manage spending limits. Lastly, full transparency on the destination of money to ensure users stay informed.

### 1.2.2: Balancing Dual Currency Economics

The dual currency system (standard and premium) may create a pay-to-win environment, where non-paying or lower-paying users feel disadvantaged and unable to access high-value rewards or items. To mitigate this risk, periodic events with milestones rewards are introduced, allowing users to earn free premium items upon completing quests. This ensures fair progression and gives non-paying players an opportunity to access premium items.

### 1.2.3: Cheating and System Integrity

Users may try to fake step counts or manipulate data, which could affect the app’s accuracy and fairness. To prevent this, multiple sensors are used to detect any inconsistencies in step data. Furthermore, Server-side analytics and machine learning algorithms are used to identify unusual activity patterns. Lastly, routine data checks and a community reporting system are also implemented to ensure integrity and fairness of the game.

## 2: Market Section

### 2.1: Market Research Questions

Is there a real demand for this gamified fitness app? What specific health and fitness goals are users struggling to consistently achieve? Understanding which demographics most are attracted to gamified fitness solutions.  
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerates an explosion in home fitness apps as users sought engaging ways to stay active while confined at home (Consagoustech, 2023). During this period, many fitness apps began integrating gamified elements to make workouts and progress tracking more enjoyable. In fact, data indicates that as many as 75% of users cite gamification as key motivator, suggesting that fun, interactive features are essential to sustained engagement (Mathai, 2025). In contrast, traditional mobile health apps often fail to hold users’ interest; a study found that approximately 53% of traditional mobile health apps are uninstalled within 30 days, with 31.6% of users attributing abandonment to a lack of interest or declining motivation (Mustafa et al., 2022).

In response to these challenges, many fitness apps introduced in-game rewards such as badges, and trophy. However these generic incentives often fall short, they can feel plain, unmemorable, and fail to spark long-term engagement. In contrast, CityWalk leverages collectible buildings as unique virtual rewards that serve as personalized symbols of progress. These visually distinct incentives create a deeper emotional connection with users, reinforcing intrinsic motivation and a tangible sense of achievement (iseazy.com, 2025). Moreover, users express a desire for features that offer not just rewards but also social and community support. Similar to popular games like Hay Day, where collecting rare items generates pride and encourages friendly competition, CityWalk’s model integrates social sharing, leaderboards, and clan-based challenges to foster community and motivate regular walking.

This model is particularly appealing to young game enthusiasts who enjoy interactive digital experiences, usually between the ages of 18 and 35. There is, however, also the possibility of reaching an older demographic (35–50 years old), who are looking for further encouragement to continue regular exercise regimens and enhance their general health. This target audience includes both beginner and casual exercisers who may require additional encouragement to be consistent.

Are users willing to spend money on the app, and how? What is the average monthly spending on fitness apps and mobile in-app purchases among our target demographics? How do people respond to the specific concept of "wagering" money for their walking goal.

In the mobile app landscape, detailed average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) data for gamified fitness apps is limited; however, industry benchmarks from the broader mobile gaming sector indicate an ARPPU of approximately USD 12 per month (GameAnalytics, 2019). Studies on freemium models further reveal free-to-paid conversion rates typically ranging between 2% and 5% (Plotline, 2022). A recent survey in Australia found that Gen Z spends on average about USD 80 on maintaining their fitness (News.com.au, 2025).

Furthermore, innovative monetization strategies—such as wagering real money on one’s own walking goals—present promising avenues for driving additional revenue. Analyses suggest that younger users are more inclined to engage in such real-money wagering to accelerate progress or unlock exclusive rewards (HealthyWage, 2021). By incorporating a premium virtual currency system—where users can wager on achieving daily or weekly walking targets in exchange for collectible rewards like virtual buildings—the app creates a unique value proposition that contrasts with traditional, generic in-app purchases.

How big is the market for this app? Market research about the percentage of mobile users who engage with in-app purchases and growth trends in fitness app and mobile gaming.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of fitness app users worldwide has surged by 55% compared to pre-pandemic levels, reaching an estimated 368 million users (Adeyemi, 2024). By 2025, the fitness app market is expected to be worth around USD 10.11 billion, with projections indicating it could grow to USD 30.73 billion by 2030 (pitchbook, 2025).

The healthcare gamification market is also expanding rapidly. Valued at USD 3.3 billion in 2021, it is expected to reach USD 9 billion by 2031. Meanwhile, the gamified mobile healthcare app market is projected to exceed USD 31 billion by 2033 (Alied Market Research, 2023). This growth reflects a rising demand for engaging and interactive health solutions.

On the investment side, U.S. digital health funding has also seen significant growth, reaching USD 17.2 billion in 2024 (Galen Growth, 2024). This surge in funding highlights growing investor confidence in digital health innovations.

## 3: Strategy Section

### 3.1: Operational Plan

#### 3.1.1: Main Goal

The primary objective of our business is to drive user engagement by integrating health improvement with interactive game mechanics and social competition. We aim to steadily increase profits through in-app purchases, directly striking people’s desire to grow and see the fruits of their efforts—in this case, by building their cities. This requires a strong creative design for buildings, as well as achievements that encourage users to become emotionally invested. A continuous introduction of special offers, unique buildings, and new achievements will maintain engagement. These behavioral incentives not only encourage users to lead healthier lifestyles but also provide an engaging, competitive, and personal experience centered around city-building.

#### 3.1.2: Team Roles & Responsibilities

To ensure the project’s success, a well-structured team is essential. The Executive Leadership consists of the CEO/Founder, who provides vision, leadership, and strategic decision-making. There will then be four main teams: the Product Development Team, the Marketing Team, the Accounting Team, and the HR/Recruitment Team. The Product Development Team includes UX/UI Designers, which are responsible for creative and intuitive and engaging user interface; they will be designing the overall application as well as selecting the theme of the product depending on user preferences. They also include Software Developers, who handle both front-end and back-end development. Front-End Developers focus on user interactions, ensuring a smooth experience, while Back-End Developers manage databases, real-time data processing, and security infrastructure. The Testing Team is tasked with ensuring the application runs smoothly by identifying and fixing bugs. Next, the Marketing Team is responsible for branding, advertising, and user acquisition strategies, while the Accounting Team oversees budget allocation and financial management.

As an 8-member team, we recognize the need to take on multiple roles and put in extra effort. We delegate work to our members based on skill, experience, and passion. However, due to time constraints, we understand that progress may not always be at the desired pace. Ideally, we aim to bring in new team members who believe in this startup project and are willing to contribute, rather than hiring external freelancers, given our budget constraints.

#### 3.1.3: Product Development Roadmap

**Phase 1: Pre-Development/Prototyping**  
At this stage, our primary focus is on validating the concept through comprehensive market research to evaluate demand, analyze competitors, and understand user needs. This requires the Marketing Team to carry out surveys and investigate pre-existing concepts; searching for inspiration which will elevate our concept further. Meanwhile, the Product Development Team starts the prototyping process to create initial wireframes and interactive models that define user experience and core functionalities. The Accounting Team gathers the necessary resources as written in Section 3.3. Additionally, a legal review is essential to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and intellectual property laws. While we have assigned a team member to conduct an initial legal study in Section 3.7, we recognize that hiring a lawyer would provide more thorough and reliable guidance, despite the additional cost.

**Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development**  
In this phase, the team develops the core features essential for user engagement, such as step tracking, gamification elements, and social competition. For this task, an agile development approach will be employed to ensure there is iterative progress with regular feedback loops. Trello will therefore be used to record our tasks with each sprint. There will be meetings around 1-2 times per week to discuss any ideas or issues that arise and every two weeks we will also hold a sprint demo where our members present their work and what their current progress is. We aim to have meetings in person; however, they can also be done in Microsoft Teams. Testing is another essential and continuous process which must be integrated into development cycles to identify and address technical flaws early which will be carried out by the Testing Team. Section 3.4 explores our initial financial plan, which is also crucial for developing our MVP and hiring extra personnels to address skill gaps, such as concept artists.

**Phase 3: Beta Testing & User Feedback**  
A beta launch is conducted to gather real-world insights from early adopters. Feedback collection mechanisms, including surveys, analytics, and user forums, help refine the platform. The Product Development Team makes iterations based on user input, improving performance and engagement.

**Phase 4: Public Launch**  
Before the official launch, the Product Development Team focuses on launch preparation, including optimizing infrastructure, finalizing security protocols, and ensuring scalability. A marketing campaign is also deployed to attract users through social media, influencers, and advertisements. This will be carried out according to Section 3.5.

**Phase 5: Post-Launch & Continuous Improvement**  
After the public release, ongoing feature expansion is implemented based on user demand and any technological advancements. We aim to monitor user engagement and technical performance to ensure continued success. Each month, it is necessary that we review our profits and set our goals accordingly. We understand that continuous improvement can only be achieved through insights gained from analytics and user feedback.

#### 3.1.4: Core Values

1. **Engagement:** We believe that gamification has the power to drive behavior change (Mathai, 2025). By integrating interactive mechanics with health improvement, we create an environment where users feel continuously motivated to reach their personal goals.
2. **Innovation & Creativity:** We strive for constant innovation in game design, user experience, and engagement strategies. Through unique building mechanics and events, we ensure a fresh and immersive experience for users.
3. **Community & Social Connection:** Social competition fosters stronger engagement, accountability, and fun. We prioritize building a thriving community where users can challenge, support, and celebrate achievements with each other.
4. **Sustainability & Longevity:** We aim for long-term success by fostering sustainable engagement strategies and financial models. Through responsible monetization, ethical advertising, and continuous game improvements, we create a product that can thrive and grow over time.

### 3.2: Roles and Capabilities of our Team

### 3.3: Gathering Resources

To successfully launch our product, we require various resources across multiple domains, including human capital, technical infrastructure, financial resources, and strategic partnerships. Each of these plays a critical role in ensuring the product’s development, market penetration, and long-term sustainability.

#### 3.3.1: Human Capital

We need a skilled and adaptable team for the creation of the product as well as business growth. We need software engineers, UI/UX designers, and product managers to design, build, and iterate the app based on customer feedback and performance data. Marketing, sales, and support teams will also be critical in customer acquisition, customer retention, and retaining happy customers. With the regulatory setting, financial and legal advisers must navigate compliance requirements—particularly monetary transaction-based compliance—and to install good financial controls.  
**Where we will find them:** We will first utilize our own knowledge and connections to recruit key roles. As we grow, we will recruit the remaining team through strategic hiring and potential partnerships with freelancers or agencies.

#### 3.3.2: Technological Infrastructure

Our application requires robust cloud services and secure servers for hosting, data storage, and application scalability. This infrastructure should be able to support user growth without sacrificing data security and compliance with relevant privacy laws. Development tools and analytic software will also be required to track user engagement, refine features, and ensure smooth operation.  
**How we will get them:** We could negotiate with tech providers to receive startup packages, reducing the initial costs. We could also explore partnerships with other tech companies.

### 3.4: Financial Plan

For the successful launch of the product, we expect an initial funding amount of £50 - £90. This capital will be utilized in domains like product development, marketing, operations, and law compliance. Most of the money will be used for creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), i.e., software development, cloud hosting, and security arrangements. A large portion will also be for marketing to acquire users through targeted online ads. This would be around £10- £20 (Raffle reward), as we save money on ad expenditure by promoting the app with our own social accounts. Part of it will also go towards hiring important personnel, such as the artist for our game graphics (Hiring artists through Fiverr £15- £25).

We will utilize a multi-phase financing approach to help support the development, launch, and growth of our product. This will include seed funding that expands through venture capital rounds, alternative models for finance, and revenue generation through a freemium model to ensure sustainable growth and invite investors through different stages of our business.

Our seed capital will be invested in us using a mix of personal funding, angel investment, and entry into an accelerator program. The capital will be employed towards the creation of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), early-stage market validation, and starting brand awareness initiatives. Through early investment, we will be able to create a working product that proves its viability to users and potential future investors.

Once our MVP gains user traction and validates market demand, we will seek Series A funding from venture capitalists who specialize in technology or fitness startups. This investment will enable us to scale operations, enhance product features, expand marketing efforts, and improve infrastructure. As we grow, we will explore subsequent funding rounds (Series B, C, etc.) to support further expansion, geographic reach, and team growth.

To diversify our sources of funding, we will be searching through crowdfunding platforms with the aim of raising capital while also establishing a network of interested early adopters. We will equally engage in strategic collaborations and revenue-sharing arrangements with complementary companies or brands with a high potential of proffering funding that considers long-term partnership dedication to be mutually rewarding and hence will minimize the utilization of massive equity-based financing.

We shall be financially independent in the long term by having a freemium business model. Basic use of the app will be free to gain mass adoption, and premium features such as challenges of higher stakes, more gamification tools that are more advanced, or premium content will be paid for. This strategy both improves cash flows and validates our business model instantaneously by forcing users to pay, giving investors better confidence in monetizing our product.

By combining seed investment, venture capital, alternate funding, and self-generating revenue models, we will establish a financially stable platform for our business and facilitate scalable growth with diminished unmerited risk.

### 3.5: Marketing Plan

To successfully enter the market and establish a strong user base, we will implement a multi-faceted marketing strategy that combines digital outreach, influencer marketing, promotional campaigns, and strategic partnerships. This approach ensures we attract early adopters, build brand awareness, and create long-term customer retention strategies that make it harder for users to switch to competitors.

Our initial target audience consists of fitness enthusiasts, competitive individuals, and tech-savvy users who are drawn to gamified experiences. To gain early traction, we will focus on reaching young professionals, college students, and fitness hobbyists—demographics that are highly active on social media and responsive to digital engagement.

A strong online presence will be the key to engaging our audience properly. We will utilize targeted ads on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook as such contents tend to perform well there, especially in the challenges and fitness genres. We'll utilize SEO (Search Engine Optimization) techniques for search phrases that are popular on search engines, such as how to get fitness motivation, gamified exercise, or fitness challenges. In addition, we will develop engaging content to present the unique value proposition of our app—highlighting the synergy between fitness and gamification to motivate user engagement. This will include video tutorials, customer testimony, and social media interactive challenges to encourage sharing and increase virality.

To establish credibility and induce adoption, we will partner with fitness influencers and thought leaders who resonate with our target audiences. These partnerships will provide us with authentic endorsement, creating trust and brand recognition. Outside of influencer marketing, we will develop a large community by conducting virtual fitness challenges, competitions, and leaderboard-based events. Incentivizing the sharing of users' progress, achievements, and experiences will create a network effect, making the app more valuable the more users join.

To ensure user retention and make it harder for the customers to switch to competitors, we will develop long-term value in the app. Out of features like personalized fitness tracking, rewards, special challenges, and strong social, we will ensure users establish a connection with their progress and in-app community. Additionally, as users participate in more challenges and accumulate rewards and rankings, they become more invested in the platform, making the transition to a competitor less appealing.

By implementing this comprehensive marketing strategy, we will effectively penetrate the market, attract early adopters, and establish a loyal user base, positioning our product for long-term success.

### 3.7: Legal Status and Structure of our Business

Our business follows a business-to-consumer (B2C) model, and so it is crucial to establish a close connection with our consumers through regular engagement, making sure to use consumer-friendly language and to avoid the use of business jargon. Engagement with consumers involves raising awareness of our app and convincing people to use it, as well as gathering feedback on the quality of our app, for example evaluating the usability of user interface prototypes.

In terms of the legal status of our business, due to student visa restrictions we cannot keep any profits earned from our product. Therefore, all proceeds will be donated to charity. This type of work is considered ‘volunteering’, since no contractual obligations are involved (as opposed to ‘voluntary work’), and the team does not keep profits. Volunteering is not subject to any student visa restrictions (University of Bath, 2025).

Although the app involves a ‘wagering system’, it cannot be reasonably classed as ‘gambling’ since the outcome of users winning does not rely solely on pure chance and is instead vastly determined by the users’ commitments to maintaining their fitness goals.

Since we are running a paid service, we must ensure that users agree to a clear set of terms and conditions prior to using the app. The terms and conditions will clearly establish the eligibility of users, guidelines detailing acceptable usage of the app, payment and billing information, and refund information.

In addition to this, users must also agree to a privacy policy, which is necessary since the app collects users’ personal data such as the number of steps they have walked per day, as well as their location. The privacy policy will clearly establish to the users how this data is gathered, used, and stored. Again, both documents will be written in a consumer-friendly language.
