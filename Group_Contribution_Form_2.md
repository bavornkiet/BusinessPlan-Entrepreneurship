## Group Contribution Form

This form must be submitted by one designated group member on behalf of the entire team.

Before submission, all group members must discuss and agree on the contribution percentages. The final agreed percentages should be fairly distributed based on actual effort and signed by all group members.

Use the table below to list the names of all group members (including your own) and indicate each person's relative contribution in percentage terms. If all members contributed equally, the contribution should be divided evenly (e.g., in a 5-person group, each member would contribute 20%).

If there are significant differences in contribution, a brief explanation must be provided in the Notes section.

### The "Sharing the Pie" Analogy

Think of the coursework as a pie—each member gets a slice based on how much effort they put into the project. If someone did more work, their slice will be bigger; if someone contributed less, their slice will be smaller. This allocation will directly impact individual marks, so it’s important to be honest and fair in your assessment.

If you are experiencing group issues, please reach out as soon as possible—we encourage early resolution rather than waiting until submission.
